<p>All data in this demonstration were produced by tagging
projects
sponsored by the University of Hawaii <a
 href="http://imina.soest.hawaii.edu/PFRP/">Pelagic
Fisheries Research Program (PFRP)</a>.</p>
<p>The conventional tagging data come from the Hawaii Tuna
Tagging
Program. The HTTP was designed to provide scientific information on
the dynamics of yellowfin (<i>Thunnus albacares</i>) and bigeye (<i>T.
obesus</i>) tuna populations in the Hawaiian archipelago. The project
was designed and implemented by Kim Holland of the <a
 href="http://www.hawaii.edu/himb/">Hawaii
Institute of Marine Biology</a> and David Itano of the PFRP. The
project depended
completely on the cooperation of fishermen to assist tagging
operations in Hawaii and to return recaptured tags from all around
the Pacific. Over 12,000 yellowfin and bigeye tuna tagged were and
released in the Hawaiian Archipelago between 1995 and 2005. About 40%
were yellowfin and 60% were bigeye. As of April 2006 over 2500 of
these tagged fish have been recaptured. Most recaptures occurred near
Hawaii, but tags were also recaptured near Japan and California. </p>
<p>The data from this project revealed fundamental differences
in
habitat usage between the two species and between different types of
aggregation. In particular, the results reveal that bigeye tuna
exhibit a longer associations with topographic features than had been
previously suspected. The results also reveal that the fishing
mortality on these two species in Hawaii is a small fraction of the
movement of fish away from Hawaiian waters due to emigration.</p>
<p>The conventional tagging data was augmented with data from
archival tags deployed in the vicinity of Hawaii by Mike Musyl of the
PFRP. These tags were deployed to explore the potential for using
archival tags on deep diving species such as bigeye tuna. The data
stored in the tag were used to compute a series of nominal daily
position estimates. The Kalman filter statistical model was used to
recover the most probable tracks from the nominal position estimates.
</p>
<p>Both of these projects were partially funded under
Cooperative
Agreement No. NA67RJ0154 from National Oceanographic Atmospheric
Administration and administered by the Pelagic Fisheries Research
Program, Joint Institute of Marine and Atmospheric Research of the
University of Hawaii.</p>
